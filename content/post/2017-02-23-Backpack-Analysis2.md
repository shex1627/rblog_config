01/30/2017  
This is the second morning which I stopped logging my backpack items, and I 
forgot to bring my binders.I think one of the main benefits of doing so ensures I always have a pencil 
and pen inside my backpack.   

Today is 02/21/2017   
I am restoring the long abandoned backpack Analysis. 
The main goal is to avoid missing things when I need them.
