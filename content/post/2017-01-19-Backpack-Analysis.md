The idea comes up when I forgot my classbinder. And recently I realize I don't really use the books that I carried. So I want to log all the things that I bring when I go out.  

### definition
*go out*: leaving home/apartment for more than 1 hour.  

### Objectives/Questions to reflect on:
1.do I need to carry ..., do I actually use ...?
2.how do I prepare things in advance?
3.want to check if I bring all the things I need before I head out  

### Brainstorming:
In a normal school setting, I bring the following items in order of frequencies/importance:
almost all the time:
phone, id-card(with buspass), wallet
often:
pen/pencil and sometimes an eraser
backpack: pen things, books, exercise books, notes, sometimes water bottle
special items: umbrella, markers, laptops(too big to bring unless have to)

### What to do next?
1.need to timestamp everytime I leave my apartment/home, with the items that I bring out.
Mostly the flexible items would be the choice of book and notes.
