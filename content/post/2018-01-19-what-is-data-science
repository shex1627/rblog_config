I am curious what I could learn from data. What insights I could see while others can't.  

That was back then when I didn't really know the big data hype.  

Now near graduation,  
1.I am applying for data scientist jobs. I wonder what I could bring to the companies.  
2.Lots of my friends are taking statistics, sort of following the hype.  

I think two things generally interest me and "data science" may be able to help me 
with that:
1.learn more things
2.solve/approach problems
3.have fun 

But those are so generic terms. In real life, I don't have any experience solving 
interesting problems. The only one I am decently proud of is the "deep work learning"
project, which is only applicable to me.  

To be honest, I think I am a better-than-avg learner, even in Berkeley. But I feel
I am not as competitive as I could be. I don't doubt that I have learned a lot in 
Berkeley but I could be in a much better shape than I am right now. I guess learning
how to deal with reality should be in the data science curriculumn. 

I wonder what I could bring to companies. I lack experience. On a positive note, I 
could force myself to be a better learner. 

### Data can't solve problems. Thinking and actions may do better. 
When I do my human learning project, tracking my data doesn't mean anything. Even if 
big companies are trying hard to learn from the enormous data that they have.  

To build meaningful relationships, you have to meet others; you have to have some 
good principles(maybe from Dale Carnegie's book) that you spend tons of time to 
practice on. 

There are things/skills that you need to invest a lot to harvest the reward.
### What are the problems I have to deal with

### Learning Statistics, Math and Cs to develop my mind
I remember when I was thinking about majors at high school. I want to learn something 
genearl, which opens me to more opportunities. I believe those are good tools for me 
to become a better thinker, to do things better.
