## **Summary**
The article first introduces the concept of p-hacking - researchers could tweak 
variables in the study or other things to reach the convention 0.05 significant
level, in order to get their research published. Then she explains that scientists
mildly tweak p-value often because of personal biased or some other incentives, 
and only a very small portion researchers are actually fabricating data and hack the peer review system.

Then the author introduces some positive changes in the science self-correction 
mechanisms - an online blog Retraction Watch that audits other researches, and i
other good internet research platform provides frameworks and support for good and open science. 

At the end the author has a small reflection that could be summarized as: science 
is not broken, even though it is probably much messier and harder than we think it is. 

## **Thoughts**:
As more and more people are joining the academia, or doing research(somehow positively 
correlated to the increasing undergraduates), I think the academia is going to 
be messier. The proportion of people who are “cheating  the system” will probably 
increase, even under the control of the growing self-correction mechanism.

More different personalities, interests and background adds diversity but also 
other things. One of my friend could do well on a True and False question by simply 
marking all every extra topic mentioned in the lecture “True” in the midterms and 
test. He is no doubt a smart person and motivated to get a phd seems for higher 
paying jobs, but I am not sure if his interest is geared enough toward scientific 
advancement. I think I may be over-worrying since similar problem is probably been 
in the academia for a long time(thinking about the human-side drama in the old days:
[controversy between Newton and Leibniz, and Ronald Risher and the Lung Cancer controversy](https://mathblog.com/separating-the-math-and-the-mathematician/))

But I do advocate and hope universities and colleges could update their coursework 
at a more adaptive rate(a better self-correction mechanism on Higher Education). 
Because eventually some undergraduates are going to become researchers. For instance, 
despite hearing many voices criticizing the misuse of p-values(such as the 
[ASA’s Statement of p-Values: Context, Process, and Purpose](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108?scroll=top&needAccess=true&)  and Nate Silver’s Signal and the Noise),
I still see courses related to p-value testing is still being taught with almost 
the same materials. At least I am expecting to see some professors would put sufficient 
focus warning students the limitations of the p-values. With good chance, I think 
this is happening but I am just ignorant about it.
