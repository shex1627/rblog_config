Recap:
A while a ago, I read a book called Deepwork. Then I decided to keep track of my studying/work data to improve my focus and productivity. 

New developments:
Besides tracking how much time I spend doing what, along with sub-tasks. I also track additional information about a task, such as 

Focus (from 1 to 0): my focus during the time
Motivatoin: punishing for low focus or being distracted

Difficulty (from 1 to 2): the difficulty of the task
Motivation: reward more taking on difficult task. Some times I am less focused because it is hard. 

Leverage (from 1 to 2): the importance of the task that I am doing 
Motivation: reward for working on important things

And then I will multiply the time I spent on a task to all the coefficients to get an adjusted
Productivity score for the task. 

At the end of the day, I can see 
Things I work on,
How much time I spent working on them, 
And an overall score of my adjusted productivity 

To automate calculations of adjusted productivity, I shift data platform from google doc to google spread sheet. 

Here are my thoughts on my new experiments:
Pros:
Data is much more organize
Many computations are easier 

Cons:
Less description 
Havenâ€™t fully integrated tracking the metrics and analyzing them yet
Have to create a new sheet for each day, at some point I have to develop some tools to store everything in a sort of database. 

Things to do:
Assign leverage and difficulties on some tasks, such as
School work in general should have leverage 1
Job apps stuff should have leverage and difficulty 1.5
Daily reflection and daily planning are in a critical stage right now so the first
15min should be 1.4/1.5 the rest should probably be 1.
